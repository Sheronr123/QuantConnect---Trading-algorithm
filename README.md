A simple algorithm to show that if we have 50% drop from our intial close price of the Citi Group, we sell all the shares. 

A further functionality is also added in to ensure that on any given day if we experience more than 5% drop between opening and closing price, we are setting the stoploss price to 75% of initial price of our share. 

This was tested out during the timeframe of the 2008 financial crises to show how limit losses could have helped during that period. 

The raw price of the shares are used rather than the adjusted price as raw price is not effected by dividents or splits and shows the true value of the stock.
